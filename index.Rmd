### What is the point of the lab section?

The lab section serves as a way to go from the theoretical and conceptual materials and transform them into the practical applications that they serve. In lecture, you will learn about *why* a certain statistic is calculated when dealing with specific data, in lab, you will learn *how*. 

Additionally, the labs will serve as a way to review the material on the exercises. I will give you problems with different numbers, but they will test the same type of knowledge that the exercises aim to test. 

If you miss a lab, it is quite difficult to catch up. I will do my best to make my notes available, but there is a difference in reading it versus seeing it first hand. 

During lab you will be shown how to do various parts of the exercises using R-Studio. This is the best time for you to ask me any questions you have.
