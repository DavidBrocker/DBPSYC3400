```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x = sample(1:100,20)
pop_mean = sample(1:70,1)
pop_sd = sample(rnorm(10,7),1)
```

## Practice Problem

Look at the following dataset:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x
````

A researcher has shown that the population mean is `r pop_mean` and the standard deviation is `r pop_sd`. Use the Z-Test to find out if this sample is different from the established mean and standard deviation.
